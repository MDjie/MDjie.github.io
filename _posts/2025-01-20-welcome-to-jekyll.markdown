    now I should reprogramming my remain time to achieve something. There are three objetcives:
        1. music improvement(could free company for any simple pop song,play at least 10 songs completely and smoothly.could visual play with fingerboard diagram)
        2. 4w-peoject.(part time job)
        3. quantum technics
                                                                    Threre are two lines:
        1. do not sleeping after 23:10
        2. do not jf more than one time within 7-days.
    how many time do I have?
        nearly whole day.
    how to arrange them?
        dat-time:
            8:30~17:30:2-target 1-target  3-target
            19:00~21:00: practicing guitar and singing.
            21:00~22:30: relaxing........

    ok, about one and a half month passed, there is something changed:
        1. I decided to continue my work till 7-25, which make sure I could earn 30k.
        2. zou is willing to bring me with a aaai project, if that success, I will learn get some experience on how to public a ccf-a
            period. And a no.2 author of his paper.
        3. there are two main interested domain: quatum mechanism & hacker
    so here is the plan next:
        
        I will continue to obey the two lines:
             1. do not sleeping after 23:10
             2. do not jf more than one time within 7-days.
        Sure, the music is one thing I am pretty sure that I will achieve.
        My obejctive until 9:could free company for any simple pop song,play at least 10 songs completely
            no.1 Song:白兰鸽巡游记
            no.2 Song:晴天
            no.3 Song:彩虹
            no.4 Song:稻香
            no.6 Song:全世界失眠
            no.8 Song:someone like you
            no.9 Song:平凡之路
            no.10 Song:you belong to me
            The time arrangement is also adoptive while I make some little change:
            19:00~21:00: practicing guitar and singing.
            21:00~22:30: relaxing........
            22:30~23:00: do something peaceful since I can sleep quickly;
            23:00~7:30(50) sleeping......
        as for brain thing, now that I have made a sacrifice, I don't need to care about the economic thing,
            But I am little sure that I can't step into the quatum mechanism quickly, so I decide to step into abother
            field: hack webApplication. so as for the arrangement in day time:
            8:30-18:00:
            if(get work to do):  handle the work task
            else(if need to coroperate with zou in NLP): learn and follow him
            else: study hacker's handy book and practice.

    after about a month of study, I nearly finished the tasks about the paper project, I write a website for human annotation, even only three people are using so far.
    And I plan to quit in next week, about twenty days earlier than the schedule I made before. My room mates have found their new domitory, so for their sake, it's perfect to 
    terminate the contract. While, I don't mad at that, cause I just can't wait to leave this prision early. 
    Even just think about the scene when I step out of that glassic door and would never back again make me excited! This work is a tortue, I sell my time for tuition and deposite. Although the meagar salary 
    could never afford the cost of my monther's theropy and my grandmother's hearing-aid.But I have no ther channels to make a big money for that.
    Even that, I think it;s worthwhile for me to pay for some booze for drunk amd commemorating.

    As for my schedule, I think I am stick to my music dream while concerning about it's boundless.It's not difficult for me to play ten songs well if I just continue to 
    practice them every day. But that make me feels like picking ten heavy stones in my pocket. Making me feel bad. I wish What I am doing is right. Now I am doing a music theory train: a train to obtain the ability to identifying the interval between two notes 
    a fret train to find a specific position's note and a note's all positons on fret board in C Major tone. And a exercise to familarize myself to the different tonic shape and the corresponding scale shape.
    
    Why I decide to do this? Actually, My objective on music can be divided into three different level, first level, learn ten my favorate songs(I mean sing while playing) second level: impromptu accopaniment. third and the most high level: could create my own songs.
    Now I am suited in the process between the first and second level. I know If I want further improvement, I have to known more about music, about guitar. specificly, I should be able to perform smoothly on guitar in different key at least in a Major scale, then go to arpeggio, chord
    Then I have to train my ear to find the key, chords progression. Finally, I could reach the second level.
